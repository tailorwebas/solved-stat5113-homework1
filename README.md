<strong>A1: </strong>Find the MLE of the unknown parameter <em>θ </em>∈ (0<em>,</em>1) based on one observation of <em>X </em>∼ <em>Bin</em>(<em>n,θ</em>). Are there particular values of the data <em>x </em>for which the MLE does not exist?

<strong>A2: </strong>Find the MLE of the unknown positive parameter <em>θ </em>from a random sample of size <em>n </em>from the continuous uniform distribution on [0<em>,θ</em>].

<strong>A3: </strong>Consider independent random variables with:

<em>X<sub>i </sub></em>∼ <em>N</em>(<em>µ</em><sub>1</sub><em>,σ</em><sup>2</sup>)<em>,            i </em>= 1<em>,</em>···<em>,n</em><sub>1</sub><em>,            Y<sub>j </sub></em>∼ <em>N</em>(<em>µ</em><sub>2</sub><em>,σ</em><sup>2</sup>)<em>,            j </em>= 1<em>,</em>···<em>,n</em><sub>2</sub><em>,</em>

Formulate the statistical model and derive the MLE of the unknown parameters.

<strong>A4: </strong>The Lognormal distribution is sometimes used to model positive quantities and it has density

Compute MLEs of <em>µ </em>and <em>σ </em>based on the leukemia survival data described in class. Compare the fit of the Lognormal model with that of the Gamma and Weibull models: which model appears to give the best fit for the survival data?

<strong>B1: </strong>Consider a random sample from the family of distributions defined by the pdf

where <em>x</em><sub>0 </sub>is a known positive value ans <em>α </em>is an unknown positive parameter. Find the MLE of <em>α</em>.

<strong>B2: </strong>In R, get hold of the speed-of-light measurements by typing: sp = morley[[“Speed”]]. Use the method of maximum likelihood to fit both a normal and a Gamma model to the data. Which model gives the best fit?
